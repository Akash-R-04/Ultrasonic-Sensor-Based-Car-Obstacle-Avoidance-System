# Ultrasonic-Sensor-Based-Car-Obstacle-Avoidance-System
This Arduino sketch controls a four-wheel drive robot car with an attached servo motor, which turns an ultrasonic sensor to look left and right for obstacle avoidance. The robot can move forward, backward, turn left and right, and stop. The servo sweeps to detect obstacles and adjust the car's movement accordingly.
